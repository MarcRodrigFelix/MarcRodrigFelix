Full Stack engineer experienced with Ruby on Rails and Javascript. With a background in retail pharmacy, I am an excellent team player, and I have excellent collaborative problem-solving skills. From the first line of HTML code I wrote, I knew that coding had to be my career path. Passionate about technology that facilitates connection, community building, and human-centric support. Adept at assessing big picture initiatives and applying fact-based research that predicts desired outcomes. I value clear and transparent communication that builds trust amongst team members. My goal is to join a team that is always willing to educate and learn from each other, to push further together.
